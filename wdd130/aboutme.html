    <h2>Joey Boehner (Bay-ner). yes I know how it looks and know how people pronounce it.</h2>
    <h2>Hello everyone, my name is Joey, Im currently working toward my Computer Science Major, with the goal of pursuing a career in game design/development.

Some of the things I love to do in my free time are gaming, coding projects, hiking, music. Right now, Im working as a support tech at the IT deparment on campus, and Im excited to build new skills here at BYU Idaho.

One of the things I love most about BYU Idaho is the supportive community and the faith-centered learning environment. Learning about web design will help me both professionally and personally whether thats building a career in tech, creating personal projects, or helping others with their web needs.

Ive been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for my whole life, I love the scripture Alma 36:27.

A little extra about me: I have moved 17 different times.

Im really looking forward to learning with all of you this semester!</h2>
