          <p>The Hollow Knight is the principal boss encounter in Hallownest: a towering, disciplined vessel consumed by infection. As a boss, the Hollow Knight challenges the player with precise, patterned attacks, rapid lunges, and a devastating second phase that raises the stakes. Learning its timings and openings is key to victory — defeating the Hollow Knight resolves an important story thread and rewards the player with closure and unique rewards.</p>
