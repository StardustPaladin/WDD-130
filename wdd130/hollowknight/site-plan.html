        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        The home wireframe focuses on a bold hero area (large image or illustration), three feature cards below (quick links to the map, character guide, and community), and a consistent header + footer on every page. The wireframe image shows placement of header/logo/nav, hero, cards, and footer.
      </p>
      <img class="wireframe" src="images/wireframe-home.svg" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>Explore Hallownest</h3>
      <p>
        The Explore page wireframe centers an map on the left with a details panel on the right. Users click markers on the map and see related content or pop-ups in the content panel. The wireframe demonstrates column layout and where controls (zoom, filters) will live.
      </p>
      <img class="wireframe" src="images/wireframe-explore.svg" alt="explore page wireframe">

      <h3>Legends of Hallownest</h3>
      <p>
        The Legends page wireframe shows a list of characters / bosses on the left and a larger detail panel on the right. Search/filter UI sits at the top of the content area. This layout supports reading lore entries and viewing boss details without leaving the page.
